# ðŸ› JS Practice: Constructor Functions, Factory Functions & `this`

Welcome to your JavaScript object creation practice project! In this activity, youâ€™ll get hands-on experience using **constructor functions**, **factory functions**, and understanding how the **`this` keyword** works in different contexts.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

- Use constructor functions to generate multiple object instances
- Create reusable factory functions that return new objects
- Explain what `this` refers to in different JavaScript contexts
- Identify common mistakes and fix issues related to `this`
-

##  Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the **Developer Console** (Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Console).
3. Open the `script.js` file and complete all **TODO** sections.
4. Test your work by checking the console output after each task.
5. Fix any errors you encounter and use the resources below for help.

## Exercises Youâ€™ll Complete

1. Create books using a **constructor function**
2. Create movies using a **factory function**
3. Debug a broken use of `this` in a **nested object**
4. Use `this` in a **counter method** that tracks clicks
5. Bonus: Fix and refactor code to use `this` correctly!

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Use `console.log(this)` inside functions to see what `this` is referencing.
- Always test your functions by creating multiple object instances.
- If something logs as `undefined`, check how youâ€™re using `this`.
